Association Maker With Mutual Benifit

SeekX as the name suggests is a portal to SeekX i.e. an unknown X. Many times people are in situations where they seek out
other people for some activity. These activities range from simple participation work in competitions to assembling groups 
for a project or maybe finding partners for a Pizza night, Movie Night or even Hangouts. Sometimes people seek other persons 
for a group study or for sharing a cab. All these activities of seeking out people can be done with SeekX portal. As the motto
goes, it's an "Association Maker for Mutual Benefit". Of course, Altruism is always welcome.
